## Hi there 👋

# 👋 Hi, I'm Josh Wiersema  
### Computer Science Student 

I'm a CS student, athlete, and freelance developer who loves building real, practical software—from full-stack apps for local businesses to algorithm-heavy C++ projects and machine learning experiments.  
I use GitHub to showcase clean, well-structured projects that reflect what I’m learning and what I can build.
